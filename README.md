# WPFClientGPT

This is a **very** basic WPF application for Windows that uses a UI similar to ChatGPT.

Add your OpenAI API key to the input field in the application to use.

This application is dependent on the OpenAI Nuget Package by OkGoDoIt.

## Limitations / Issues

It currently can only display one 'chat' (prompt plus response) at a time.
The application also only supports the gpt3.5-turbo model.
Saveing conversations does not work.
